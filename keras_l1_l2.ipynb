    "L1 and L2 regularization are two common regularization techniques that can reduce the effects of overfitting [[Cite:ng2004feature]](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~elkan/254spring05/Hammon.pdf).  Both of these algorithms can either work with an objective function or as a part of the backpropagation algorithm.  In both cases the regularization algorithm is attached to the training algorithm by adding an additional objective.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these algorithms work by adding a weight penalty to the neural network training.  This penalty encourages the neural network to keep the weights to small values.  Both L1 and L2 calculate this penalty differently.  For gradient-descent-based algorithms, such as backpropagation, you can add this penalty calculation to the calculated gradients.  For objective-function-based training, such as simulated annealing, the penalty is negatively combined with the objective score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both L1 and L2 work differently in the way that they penalize the size of a weight.  L2 will force the weights into a pattern similar to a Gaussian distribution; the L1 will force the weights into a pattern similar to a Laplace distribution, as demonstrated in Figure 5.L1L2.\n",

    "\n",
    "As you can see, L1 algorithm is more tolerant of weights further from 0, whereas the L2 algorithm is less tolerant.  We will highlight other important differences between L1 and L2 in the following sections.  You also need to note that both L1 and L2 count their penalties based only on weights; they do not count penalties on bias values. Keras allows [l1/l2 to be directly added to your network](http://tensorlayer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modules/cost.html)."
